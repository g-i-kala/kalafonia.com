        text: 'I\'m a freelance sound engineer and a music producer. Before "pandemic times" I cooperated with Stage Entertainment Touring Productions, Music Hall and Musical Theatre in Gdynia as a live sound mixer and sound designer. During the lockdowns I moved all my skills to the studio and started producing my own music. As a freelancer I concentrate on mixing and mastering. To stay fresh I\’ve started performing live. In my compositons I put big emphasis on arrangement minimalism, originality of sounds and the potential of translating my music into body motility. I\’m passionate about synthesisers and a geek of "sound toys" as I call all controllers and audio devices used in the studio and on stage.'
